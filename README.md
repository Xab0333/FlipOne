# FlipOne

## FlipOne is a discord bot that allows you to control a lot of areas of your server, and it also has its own website

#### This idea was born with the need to create a bot for discord that was easy to handle and that had a simple and uncomplicated use, to cover a high number of users

### FlipOne has a web page where we can see the main characteristics of the bot and different sections where we can apollize the creator.
Once implemented in your server (from the web page) you can use different commands such as:
! ban! kick! server! user and more.

### The flipone website has been programmed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The bot was programmed in JavaScript

## At first the web page had problems to be shown in the mobile versions, so I had to change a large part of the code and adapt it.
With regard to the bot, on several occasions the code presented a problem that it was unable to solve, causing it to have to spend a lot of development time finding them

## I am proud that the website has looked so good and the bot works perfectly

## Thanks to this project I have improved my skills as a web developer and JavaScript libraries

## Add more commands to the bot and the possibility of configuring it directly from the web page
